spart_decrypt.py

Illustration of how to read, decrypt and decode the contents
of a binary SPARTN log file e.g. from an Thingstream PointPerfect
SPARTN MQTT or NTRIP service.

NB: decryption requires the key and basedate applicable at the
time the SPARTN log was originally captured.

Usage:

python3 spartn_decrypt.py infile="inputfilename.log"

Run from /examples folder. Can use output from mqtt_spartn_client.py
example.
